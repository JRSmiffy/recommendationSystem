# recommendationSystem
Data Science Project (building a product recommendation system)

### Process - Jupyter Notebooks
* In excel, I defined personas across the brands and items (people who liked .NET, people who liked Mugs, etc)
* Using Peter's special cmd, I converted the excel cols to .csv in vi
* Load this .csv in a Jupyter Notebook
* Perform Item-Based Collaborative Filtering with Cosine Similarity
* Pass an array of strings (for the item names) and return an array of three highest recommendations (the three items which were the 'closest' to an item in the basket, across all items in the basket)
